Dataset Overview:

     This dataset comprises Arabic text samples collected from the Facebook platform, including both real and fake news articles. The texts are categorized based on their authenticity, forming a balanced dataset that serves as a valuable resource for training and analysis purposes.

Utilization of Arabic BERT Model and Spark Acceleration:

   The Arabic BERT model was employed to enhance linguistic analysis and identify language patterns within the dataset. The training process was expedited using the Spark framework, known for its efficient data processing and analysis capabilities.

Trained Models:

    CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): Leveraging deep learning techniques and convolutional layers to extract patterns and features from textual data.
    
    LR (Logistic Regression): Employing logistic regression techniques to classify data into specific categories.
    
    LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A deep neural network utilized to tackle sequential problems within textual data.
    
    BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory): Expanding LSTM models to consider context from both directions.
    
    GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit): Using deep memory networks to effectively understand context and temporal sequences.
